# Kendama Roundup

#### TODO

- [ ] combined all Kendamas from all online stores into one route
- [ ] combined all products from one store into one route
- [ ] add more stores like Sweets, Krom, Occult, Terra, Kendama USA

#### In progress...

#### Completed

- [x] Implemented route for sol kendamas including dynamically scraping multiple pages
- [x] Made it so the miner only makes a request to the url if the date is changed. I will probably realized that the way I did it was horribly buggy.
  - [x] Improve limiting of requests to API to keep bandwidth low for webShare
